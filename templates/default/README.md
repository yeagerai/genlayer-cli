## üëÄ About
This project includes the boilerplate code for a GenLayer use case implementation, specifically a football bets game.

## üì¶ What's included
- Basic requirements to deploy and test your intelligent contracts locally
- Configuration file template
<!-- - Test functions to write complete end-to-end tests -->
- An example of an intelligent contract (Football Bets)
- Example end-to-end tests for the contract provided

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- A running GenLayer Studio (Install from [Docs](https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/tooling-setup#using-the-genlayer-studio) or work with the hosted version of [GenLayer Studio](https://studio.genlayer.com/)). If you are working locally, this repository code does not need to be located in the same directory as the Genlayer Studio.

## üöÄ Steps to run this example

### 1. Configure environment
   Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`, then fill in the values for your configuration. The provided values are the standard values for a tipical GenLayer Studio deployed locally.

### 2. Deploy the contract
   Deploy the contract from `/contracts/football_bets.py` using the Studio's UI:
   1. Open the GenLayer Studio interface in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:8080).
   2. Create a new file in the "Contracts" section and paste the content of `/contracts/football_bets.py` (the content is different than the existing contract from the examples).
   3. Navigate to the "Run and Debug" section.
   4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the deployment process.

### 3. Setup the frontend environment
  1. All the content of the dApp is located in the `/app` folder.
  2. Rename the `.env.example` file in the `/app` folder to `.env`.
  3. Add the deployed contract address to the `/app/.env` under the variable `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`

### 4. Run the frontend Vue app
   Ensure your GenLayer Studio is running, and execute the following commands in your terminal:
   ```shell
   cd app
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The terminal should display a link to access your frontend app (usually at http://localhost:5173/).
   For more information on the code see [GenLayerJS](https://github.com/yeagerai/genlayer-js).
   
### 5. Test contracts
1. Install the Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file in a virtual environment.
2. Make sure your GenLayer Studio is running. Then execute the following command in your terminal:
   ```shell
   gltest
   ```

## ‚öΩ How the Football Bets Contract Works

The Football Bets contract allows users to create bets for football matches, resolve those bets, and earn points for correct bets. Here's a breakdown of its main functionalities:

1. Creating Bets:
   - Users can create a bet for a specific football match by providing the game date, team names, and their predicted winner.
   - The contract checks if the game has already finished and if the user has already made a bet for this match.

2. Resolving Bets:
   - After a match has concluded, users can resolve their bets.
   - The contract fetches the actual match result from a specified URL.
   - If the Bet was correct, the user earns a point.

3. Querying Data:
   - Users can retrieve all bets.
   - The contract also allows querying of points, either for all players or for a specific player.

4. Getting Points:
   - Points are awarded for correct bets.
   - Users can check their total points or the points of any player.

## üß™ Tests

This project includes integration tests that interact with the contract deployed in the Studio. These tests cover the main functionalities of the Football Bets contract:

1. Creating a bet
2. Resolving a bet
3. Querying bets for a player
4. Querying points for a player

The tests simulate real-world interactions with the contract, ensuring that it behaves correctly under various scenarios. They use the GenLayer Studio to deploy and interact with the contract, providing a comprehensive check of the contract's functionality in a controlled environment.

To run the tests, use the `gltest` command as mentioned in the "Steps to run this example" section.
